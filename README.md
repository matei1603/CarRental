# CarRental
  I designed and implemented a Java solution for managing the reservations for car rentals. 
  
-the program allows multiple operations for cars and reservations.

-the classes in the repository allow storing and retrieving data to/from text files, binary files or a relational database.The decision of which repositories are employed, as well as the location of the repository input files / database will be made available via the programâ€™s **settings.properties**.

-for the program's GUI I used JavaFX UI(https://imgur.com/a/jBUf7BF)
